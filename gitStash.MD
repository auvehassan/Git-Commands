# Git-Stash
Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away.
- Temporarily saves your changes and reverts your working directory to the last commit. This is useful when you need to switch to a different branch or address an urgent issue.
  ```
  git stash
  ```
-  Applies the most recent stash back to your working directory.
  ```
  git stash apply
  ```
- Applies the most recent stash and removes it from the stash list.
  ```
  git stash pop
  ```
